Package: RCNA
Title: Robust Copy Number Alteration Detection (RCNA)
Version: 1.0
Authors@R: person("Matt", "Bradley", email = "mbradley@emmes.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Detects copy number alteration events in targeted exon sequencing 
    data for tumor samples without matched normal controls. The advantage of 
    this method is that it can be applied to smaller sequencing panels including 
    evaluations of exon, transcript, gene, or even user specified genetic
    regions of interest. Functions in the package include steps for GC-content
    correction, calculation of quantile based normal karyotype ranges,
    and calculation of feature score.  Cutoffs for "normal" quantile and score
    are user-adjustable.
